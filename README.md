Abstract
The following paper is a thorough summary of the final project for the Department of
Computer, Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, of International
Hellenic University. The project focus on:
1) The development of a CAM software, which reads CAD files, extract coordinates
from geometrical shapes and generates a text file (.nc) with the corresponding G
code.
2) Hardware and Software development (planning and implementation), of a two
axis CNC.
3) The implementation of a linear and Circular Interpolation Algorithm.
Key Words: CAD, CAM , CNC , Numerical Control Interpolation
